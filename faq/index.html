<p><strong>What is Art on the Hill 2020?</strong><br /><br /><span>Art on the Hill is an art trail taking place over the weekend of 3rd and 4th of October in the Windmill Hill and Victoria Park area. It is an opportunity to show, see, interact with and buy local art from local people. It is organised by volunteers and any money received goes towards organising and publicising the trail. There will be plenty going on between viewing the art such as workshops, performances and a concert.</span><br /><br /><strong>Can anyone get involved or do I need to be a professional artist?</strong><br /><br /><span>There is no need to be a professional, in fact, we actively encourage participation by non-professionals. Whether you’re a budding photographer, a part-time knitter, an actor, painter or musician, or anything else for that matter that could be considered art, you can be involved.</span><br /><br /><strong>So how do I get involved?</strong><br /><br /><span>If you are an artist and are local you’re half way there. If you want to show your work in your own home or that of a friend or neighbour, easy, just sign up. If you don’t have a venue, we can help organise that too, by linking you to a communal venue. If you have an idea that might need a bit more thinking or help please talk to someone within the Art on the Hill Team. You can contact us via the Contact page and someone will get back to you as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p>If you are interested in helping organise the trail, you can always volunteer to be part of the AOTH team. There are often roles which need filling. We are a friendly, welcoming group and the committee meetings often feature tea and cake! <br /><br /><strong>I'm a performer and would like to be part of the trail...</strong></p>
<p>see the <a data-id="1341" href="../take-part/performers-preamble/index.html" title="Performers preamble">performers page</a> <br /><br /><strong>I’d like to offer my home as a venue, what should I do?</strong><br /><br /><span>Perfect, we’d love to have you on board. There is a registration form for people who have space available <a data-udi="umb://document/103c8c5127634114ac87734b27802476" href="../take-part/register-as-a-venue/index.html" title="Register as a venue">here.</a> You may be exhibiting yourself and feel you can offer space to someone else - if this is the case you can enter the details of space you have available when you sign up to be an artist</span><br /><br /><strong>I don’t have a venue, is there somewhere I can exhibit?</strong><br /><br /><span>There are a small number of places at public venues for artists who don't have a space to exhibit in the area, which you will be able to select from when you register. It is recommended that you sign up early if you fall into this category to avoid disappointment. When there are no places left you will still be able to sign up, and we may be able to find somewhere. If no place can be found you will be refunded.</span></p>
<p>If you have signed up to be an artist, and require a venue, the <a data-id="1110" href="#" title="Venues">venues page</a> has contact details.<br /><br /><strong>I'm not sure if I'm located within the area?</strong><br /><br /><span>The Art on the Hill area covers all of Windmill Hill and Victoria Park and crosses over the railway tracks towards Asda in Bedminster to include Whitehouse Lane and Philip Street.</span><span> Have a look at the </span><a data-id="1376" href="../map/index.html" title="Where is It" data-cke-saved-href="http://weebly-link/840983276104508481">map</a><span> for a visual representation of the area. If you're not sure whether your location could be included please get in touch.</span><br /><br /><strong>How do I sign up?</strong><br /><br /><span>All the info you need is on the <a data-id="1088" href="../take-part/index.html" title="Take Part">Take Part page</a> - you will be required to fill out some details about your work and pay your submission fee  by Paypal. The sooner you upload photos and your Artist Statement the better as they will be posted on the website for all to see.</span><br /><br /><strong>How much is the submission fee?</strong></p>
<p><span>Registration will open on 1st May and continue until 30th June. No registrations will be accepted after this date. There is a registration fee which goes towards the costs of organising and advertising the trail. There is an Early Bird fee of £30 until 31st March. After that the fee is £35. The fee is payable per artist, not per venue. Every artist has an individual entry in the Trail brochure. The price includes a book of 10 raffle tickets which you can sell to the public.</span></p>
<p><br /><strong>What should I put in my Artist’s Statement?</strong><br /><br /><span>This is the bit about you that everyone will read, it will go in the trail brochure and on the website so wants to tell people what they can expect to find if they come to see you on the trail. A short statement about you, your work and the medium you use. Word limit is 30 words.  If you would like contact details published, please include them within this statement i.e. your website address.</span><br /><br /><strong>What kind of pictures should I upload?</strong><br /><br /><span>This should be a picture that represents your work well. It will be reduced in size to approximately 2cm x 2cm to be printed in the brochure so please bear this in mind when you’re choosing your image. Your image can show your work as a whole or can be a close up of part of your work, it is entirely up to you. </span><span>Please submit square images under 5mb and ideally 300dpi.</span><span> If you have trouble with your images or do not know how to reduce file sizes please get in touch.</span><br /><br /><strong>How should I price my work on the trail weekend?</strong><br /><br /><span>You have to have a think about what you feel your work is worth, are the raw materials expensive and how long did it take to make? Try to get out to other trails and see what people are selling things for to give you an idea. It’s good to have things available for all pockets so maybe consider cheaper prints of your work or unframed versions or trinket items which you can sell at a lower price.</span><br /><br /><strong>Anything else?</strong><br /><br /><span>If you sign up to show your work then you will receive more information throughout the year and we will be updating the website with news and information for both artists and visitors to the trail. If you would like to run a workshop over the weekend please let us know.</span><br /><br /><span>Anything not covered here please </span><a data-id="1168" href="../contact/index.html" title="Contact" data-cke-saved-href="http://weebly-link/370371893516561512">contact us</a><span>.</span></p>
